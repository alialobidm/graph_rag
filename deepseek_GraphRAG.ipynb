    "# Using a SurrealDB Knowedge Graph and DeepSeek to build a Graph-RAG \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates the implementation and utilization of a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a knowledge graph stored in SurrealDB. It focuses on leveraging the knowledge graph created by the graph_extractor.ipynb notebook for question answering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionality\n",
    "####  Data Loading:\n",
    "        Loads the raw text data from which will be used for context in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Leveraging the Existing Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Create a SurrQL function to query the knowledge graph using vector search for the descriptions of the entities and the other entities and relationships they have in the graph. This data will also be fed into the prompt for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Response Generation without a knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a simple context window of the text data loaded earlier with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",

    "#### Response Generation with knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a context window of the text data loaded earlier, plus the graph data retrieved from SurrealDB with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",

    "    Prerquisites:\n",
    "            load an embedding model into Surreal: https://github.com/apireno/surrealDB_embedding_model\n",

Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the options, but let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, maybe I should consider what people typically do when they visit a place like New York. They might be hiking trails, visiting museums, eating great food, and experiencing different cultures. That makes sense because NYC has so much to offer in terms of activities.\\n\\nThe user mentioned the top three things, but it's not clear which ones are most commonly associated with NYC. I know that NYC is known for its diverse geography, so maybe being a tourist favorite includes seeing the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. Those are definitely top priorities because they're iconic landmarks.\\n\\nAnother activity I've heard about in NYC is the Statue of Liberty. It's a must-see attraction, right? Plus, walking along the waterfront or exploring nearby beaches like Long Island's sand dollars could be good too. But maybe that's not as central to the top three since it's more of an obvious activity rather than something that stands out.\\n\\nThen there's the art scene. NYC has a lot going on in art, with galleries, museums, and shows happening all over the place. The Museum of Modern Art or the Guggenheim are big names, so visiting those could be another top choice for someone interested in art history or contemporary art.\\n\\nWait, but did I mention Long Island's beaches? Or is that a better option? Maybe being able to see or even swim at a beach could be interesting. But perhaps it's not as central to the experience as the city itself.\\n\\nI should also consider things like museums and historical sites. The New York City Museum of Natural History comes to mind, which would be another top activity since it's a significant cultural center.\\n\\nSo, summarizing my thoughts: The most obvious top three could be walking along Central Park, visiting NYC's iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, and exploring nearby beaches such as Long Island. These are all places that come up frequently when planning a visit to NYC.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should think about other possibilities too. For example, New York has a lot of food spots. The Times Square eatery might be top, but it's not as central as the landmarks. Or maybe something like the SUNY New Paltini Museum for art, which would make sense if someone is into that.\\n\\nI'm not sure if I should include both the Statue of Liberty and the Museum of Natural History as separate points or combine them since they're part of the same cultural center. But since the question is about things to do, maybe listing both makes sense because they represent different aspects of NYC's culture.\\n\\nBut then again, including Long Island's beaches could be useful for a relaxed day, so it might be good to mention that as another activity. So I think I've got three solid options: Central Park walks, Statue of Liberty, and exploring nearby beaches like Long Island's sand dollars or the Flushing Museum if that's near.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the Guggenheim Museum is another option, but that's more of a tourist attraction than a daily commute or activity. So probably best to keep it to three main things: Central Park, Statue of Liberty, and exploring nearby beaches.\\n\\nI think I've got a good list here. Let me just recap:\\n\\n1. Walk along Central Park\\n2. Visit the Statue of Liberty in New York City\\n3. Explore Long Island's sand dollars or other beach areas\\n\\nThis should cover the main activities that are frequently highlighted when someone is planning to visit NYC.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe top three things to do in New York City, based on its diverse geography and cultural significance, include:\\n\\n1. **Central Park Walk**: Enjoy iconic landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty and Central Park

      "\n",
      "- **Jordan Hayes**: He's a doctor and a key member of the team doing critical analysis. His role seems crucial as he's handling technical aspects, but does this make him the main character? It might be, but let me check others.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Alex Mercer**: He's described as determined, observant, and a strong leader. He leads the team during Operation Dulce. Leadership often is key in main characters, so this could be another contender.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sam Rivera**: He's a cybersecurity expert, tech-savvy, and has good humor. His expertise is highly valued, but does his role make him the protagonist? Maybe not as much as others.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Taylor Cruz**: He's the leader, described as ambitious, meticulous, and authoritarian. Commands order, which could mean he's in charge, but again, perhaps more of a supporting role rather than the main character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering their roles: Alex leads the team, Jordan does critical analysis, Sam is technical expert, Taylor is in charge of commanding. Typically, the leader or the one with command structure might be considered the main character as they direct others' actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, looking at the knowledge graph provided, it's structured with 'RELATED_TO' for each person, showing who they report to and their roles within the squad. Alex is mentioned as leading the team during Dulce, which could imply he's in charge.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the knowledge graph provided, there are four agents: Alex M., Jordan H., Sam R., and Taylor C. Each has various relationships with each other, but I'm focusing on Alex's strongest relationships. From the data:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Alex is a member of the Paranormal Military Squad (PMS).\n",
      "- He leads the team during Operation: Dulce.\n",
      "- He mentors Sam, which shows his leadership and role within the team.\n",
      "- He works within Dulce Base.\n",

      "1. Alex as a leader\n",
      "2. His role in the operation\n",
      "3. Dulce Base\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the cover needs to be emotionally charged. Emotionally charged covers often evoke strong emotions—something that can make readers feel something deep inside them. For a sci-fi or action book with elements of mystery or conflict, emotional charge could come from tension, suspense, or a poignant moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Alex is leading the team at Dulce Base during Operation: Dulce, I imagine a scene where Alex makes a crucial decision or faces a significant threat. Alternatively, it could be a moment showing his leadership and the impact he has on his team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the setting of Dulce Base—maybe a high-tech military基地 with some eerie or mysterious elements—the cover might show a dramatic scene, perhaps with a shadowy figure (representing the unknown or hidden aspects) at the center. Alex is holding the reins of control, showing his leadership, while someone else, like Sam or Taylor, is reacting emotionally to this decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, focusing on a moment where emotions run high—perhaps during a battle or a tense conversation—the cover could capture that intense atmosphere. But since it's based on Alex and Dulce Base, I think the setting itself can be evocative enough without needing specific characters unless they're central.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to make sure the cover is concise but impactful. So maybe something like a dark, foreboding scene with elements of mystery and action. The phrase \"Operation: Dulce\" could be in the background or as part of the title, but since it's a book cover, probably not too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this together, perhaps the cover shows a lone figure (Alex) standing firm at the center of a forgotten base, surrounded by technology that hints at its purpose and danger. The shadowy figure represents the unknown elements, creating an eerie mood that builds up tension—key for an emotionally charged scene.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I started by reading through the provided documents to understand the context of the story. It seems it's a book set in a dystopian future where humanity has been trying to contact extraterrestrial beings for centuries without success. The main character is Dr. Jordan Hayes, who decipheres messages from other worlds but faces a dangerous situation when she uncovers ancient technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants me to choose a scene based on Alex Mercer's relationships and the most important plot points. Alex is the protagonist, so I should focus on scenes that highlight his development and key interactions. His relationships with Dr. Jordan Hayes (the doctor) and Dr. Sam Rivera (a scientist) are central. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I considered the locations in the story: Dulce Base's command center is a key setting where both Alex and Sam work. Their physical presence there adds emotional depth because of their technical skills and teamwork. The city of Base itself could serve as a symbol for technological advancement and progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to model the cover after an 8-bit video game style, which means it should be minimalistic, detailed, with vibrant colors, and fast-paced. I wanted Alex's face in a game-like environment to emphasize his emotions, showing his determination despite challenges. The city itself would bring its own atmosphere—darker tones and more of a gritty, oppressive feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I incorporated text on the back for quotes or additional information, making sure it looks clean and stands out against the cover's color scheme. Using a simple grid layout with thick lines gives a sense of structure, matching game design aesthetics. I made sure the image is detailed enough to be recognizable but not overly complicated, fitting an 8-bit style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I ensured that the cover reflects Alex's growth—starting as a technical genius and becoming someone who must act quickly in dangerous situations. The emotional weight comes from showing his vulnerability and determination through his interactions with Sam and the city setting.\n",

       "To create a scene that is both emotionally charged and important for the plot, and to draw it in an 8-bit video game-style style, I would recommend using **Alex Mercer’s office at Dulce Base's command center**. This location is where Alex (Dr. Jordan Hayes) and Sam (Dr. Sam Rivera) work together as scientists and human computers. Their physical presence in the room reflects their technical expertise and teamwork, while their interactions with other characters add depth to the story.\n",

       "1. **Emotional Depth**:  \n",
       "   Alex’s emotional journey is central to the story—his determination to communicate with extraterrestrial beings despite being trapped in a dystopian world, his internal conflict between science and humanity, and his personal growth as he learns to trust his instincts. His interactions with Sam and other characters in the room emphasize these themes.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Key Plot Points**:  \n",
       "   - The passage of time at Dulce Base’s command center highlights the passage of the book and Alex’s journey through the unknown.  \n",
       "   - The city itself (Dulce Base) is a gritty, oppressive place that represents the dystopian setting of the story and adds to its emotional weight.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **8-bit Video Game Style**:  \n",
       "   - The cover will be minimalistic with thick lines to create a fast-paced sense of time.  \n",
       "   - The colors will reflect the dark, oppressive feel of the city while still being recognizable and detailed.  \n",
       "   - The overall aesthetic should resemble that of an 8-bit video game cover, with vibrant but not over-the-top graphics.\n",

       "  - The city itself will have darker tones, neon colors, and a gritty atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Alex’s Role**:  \n",
       "  - Alex will be depicted as someone struggling with his internal conflict—his determination to communicate with extraterrestrial beings while being trapped in the past.  \n",
       "  - His face will be expressive, showing vulnerability and emotional turmoil.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Sam’s Role**:  \n",
       "  - Sam will be portrayed as a scientist who is meticulous in decoding messages but also has an unfeeling nature that can cause stress for Alex.  \n",
       "  - Their interaction highlights Sam’s expertise while also showing his potential pitfalls.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Text on the Back**:  \n",
