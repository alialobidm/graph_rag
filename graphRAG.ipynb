    "# Using a SurrealDB Knowedge Graph and Gemini to build a Graph-RAG \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates the implementation and utilization of a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a knowledge graph stored in SurrealDB. It focuses on leveraging the knowledge graph created by the graph_extractor.ipynb notebook for question answering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionality\n",
    "####  Data Loading:\n",
    "        Loads the raw text data from which will be used for context in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Leveraging the Existing Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Create a SurrQL function to query the knowledge graph using vector search for the descriptions of the entities and the other entities and relationships they have in the graph. This data will also be fed into the prompt for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Response Generation without a knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a simple context window of the text data loaded earlier with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response Generation with knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a context window of the text data loaded earlier, plus the graph data retrieved from SurrealDB with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### notes:\n",
    "    This notebook utilizes libraries :\n",
    "        surrealdb to interact with SurrealDB\n",
    "        google.generativeai to interact with Gemini\n",
    "        networkx to visualize the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prerquisite is to install the embedding model as in this python script:\n",
    "            https://github.com/apireno/surrealDB_embedding_model\n",
    "            and load a knowledge graph using the other notebook in this repo: graph_extractor.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "    The notebook is loosely based on a larger repository microsoft/graphrag. The microsoft/graphrag repository provides a more comprehensive, modular graph-based RAG system. This notebook focuses specifically on the knowledge graph construction aspect."

This intellectual curiosity clashes with his ingrained sense of duty, creating internal conflict that fuels his actions.\n",

This captures the core of the narrative:  the risky first contact with an alien intelligence, highlighting the collaborative effort of the team.\n",

He is depicted in his military uniform, but maybe with a futuristic twist; his weapon is slightly visible, hinting at the ongoing tension. He's looking towards a central point.\n",

       "* **Communication Interface:** The foreground will prominently feature a stylized, 8-bit representation of a complex communication interface, similar to the monitors described in the text.   Pixelated symbols and numbers (both human and alien) will scroll across the screen. The alien symbols will be distinct and evocative of a higher, or different, order of intelligence.  Bright neon colors (blue and green) will highlight active parts of the interface.\n",

       "* **The Dulce Base:**  A simplified representation of the Dulce Base will be in the background. It can be suggested through pixelated grey and brown blocks representing underground structures. Maybe the elevator shaft and the corridors are visible. The style should imply depth and mystery.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Cosmic Elements:**  Subtle hints of cosmic imagery will subtly appear in the background; perhaps a few larger pixels representing distant stars or nebulas. This background element won't overpower the foreground but adds a sense of scale and the wider implications of the operation.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Team Silhouettes:**  The silhouettes of Jordan, Taylor, and Sam will be partially visible behind Alex and the interface.  This underscores the collaborative nature of the mission and their crucial roles.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall Style:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The style will be intentionally retro, using a limited color palette and simple pixel art to evoke a sense of nostalgia while remaining visually captivating.  The overall feeling should be one of mystery, suspense, and high-stakes action, promising an engaging and thought-provoking story. The title, \"Operation: Dulce,\" will be rendered in a bold, pixelated font, matching the retro aesthetic.\n",
       "\n",
