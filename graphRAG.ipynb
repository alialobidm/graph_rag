    "# Using a SurrealDB Knowedge Graph and Gemini to build a Graph-RAG \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates the implementation and utilization of a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a knowledge graph stored in SurrealDB. It focuses on leveraging the knowledge graph created by the graph_extractor.ipynb notebook for question answering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionality\n",
    "####  Data Loading:\n",
    "        Loads the raw text data from which will be used for context in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Leveraging the Existing Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Create a SurrQL function to query the knowledge graph using vector search for the descriptions of the entities and the other entities and relationships they have in the graph. This data will also be fed into the prompt for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Response Generation without a knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a simple context window of the text data loaded earlier with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",

    "#### Response Generation with knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a context window of the text data loaded earlier, plus the graph data retrieved from SurrealDB with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### notes:\n",
    "    This notebook utilizes libraries :\n",
    "        surrealdb to interact with SurrealDB\n",
    "        google.generativeai to interact with Gemini\n",
    "        networkx to visualize the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "    The notebook is loosely based on a larger repository microsoft/graphrag. The microsoft/graphrag repository provides a more comprehensive, modular graph-based RAG system. This notebook focuses specifically on the knowledge graph construction aspect."
