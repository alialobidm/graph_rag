    "# Using a SurrealDB Knowedge Graph and Together AI hosted DeepSeek model to build a Graph-RAG \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates the implementation and utilization of a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a knowledge graph stored in SurrealDB. It focuses on leveraging the knowledge graph created by the graph_extractor.ipynb notebook for question-answering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionality\n",
    "####  Data Loading:\n",
    "        Loads the raw text data from which will be used for context in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Leveraging the Existing Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Create a SurrQL function to query the knowledge graph using vector search for the descriptions of the entities and the other entities and relationships they have in the graph. This data will also be fed into the prompt for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Response Generation without a knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a simple context window of the text data loaded earlier with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the top three things to do in New York. Let's start by recalling what New York is famous for. There's the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, Times Square, Broadway shows, museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, maybe the Empire State Building? Also, places like the High Line or the 9/11 Memorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but which ones are the most popular? I think Statue of Liberty is a big one because it's an iconic symbol. Central Park is a huge park in the middle of Manhattan, so that's probably a must-see. Times Square is always buzzing with activity and lights, so that's likely on the list. But then again, there are museums. The Met is one of the largest art museums. The Empire State Building offers great views. The High Line is a newer attraction, an elevated park. Maybe Rockefeller Center? Or the Brooklyn Bridge?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check which attractions are most recommended by travel sites. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. From what I remember, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are often in top lists. Central Park is almost always there. Then maybe Times Square or a Broadway show. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is a major museum. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum is significant too.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user is asking for top 3. So, maybe the three most iconic. Let's think about what's unique to New York. Statue of Liberty is definitely unique. Central Park is an iconic urban park. Times Square is the heart of Manhattan's theater district and known for its neon lights. Alternatively, the Empire State Building could be the third. But maybe the Met or a Broadway show? Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, when people visit New York, they often mention seeing the Statue of Liberty, walking around Central Park, and visiting Times Square. Those three are distinct and cover history, nature in the city, and the bustling city life. Alternatively, some might swap one for a museum, but the Met is huge and could take a whole day. The top three should be things that are must-see and can be experienced in a shorter time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, tentatively, the top three are: 1. Visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. 2. Explore Central Park. 3. Experience Times Square and Broadway. But I should verify if those are indeed the top recommendations. Alternatively, maybe the Empire State Building is higher. Or the 9/11 Memorial. Wait, the 9/11 Memorial is important but maybe not as iconic as the others for a first-time visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: top attractions based on visitor numbers. The Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Times Square are all free except for the statue access. But the Empire State Building has an observation deck that's popular. Maybe the top three are: 1. Statue of Liberty, 2. Central Park, 3. Empire State Building or Times Square. But which is more popular?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, some sources list Central Park, Times Square, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art as top attractions. The Met is one of the most visited museums in the world. So maybe that's in the top three. Let me think again. If I were advising a first-time visitor with limited time, what would they prioritize? Probably the iconic landmarks. So Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Times Square. Those three cover a mix of history, nature, and city culture. Broadway shows are also a big part of NYC but they might require more time and planning. The Empire State Building is a classic, but maybe not as interactive as the others. The High Line is nice but maybe not top three. The 9/11 Memorial is important but somber. So maybe the top three are the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, Times Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I should make sure there aren't other attractions that are higher. For example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a major attraction. However, when comparing to the others, the Met is a specific interest (art) whereas the others are more general. So perhaps the top three are: 1. Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, 2. Central Park, 3. Times Square and Broadway. Alternatively, some might say Central Park, Times Square, and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the top three are: 1. Statue of Liberty, 2. Central Park, 3. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. But I'm not sure. Let me check my reasoning. The Statue of Liberty is a must-see for many tourists. Central Park is a major green space and a place where many movies are filmed, so it's iconic. Times Square is the symbol of NYC's hustle and bustle, bright lights, and theater district. So those three might be the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the Empire State Building's observation deck is a classic NYC experience. Maybe swap that with Times Square? I think it depends on the person's interests. But if I have to pick the top three most recommended, most likely:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.\n",
      "2. Explore Central Park.\n",
      "3. Experience Times Square and catch a Broadway show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, some sources might list the Metropolitan Museum of Art as number three. But considering the unique NYC experiences, the Broadway shows are a big draw. So perhaps the third is Times Square/Broadway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's reasonable. So the top three would be visiting the Statue of Liberty, exploring Central Park, and experiencing Times Square along with a Broadway show. I can present those as the top three with explanations.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "**Top 3 Things to Do in New York City:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island**  \n",
      "   A symbol of freedom and immigration, the Statue of Liberty is an iconic must-see. Take a ferry to Liberty Island for up-close views, and explore Ellis Island’s Immigration Museum to learn about America’s diverse history.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Explore Central Park**  \n",
      "   Escape the urban bustle in this sprawling 843-acre green oasis. Rent a bike, row a boat on the lake, visit Bethesda Terrace, or enjoy seasonal activities like ice skating (winter) or outdoor concerts (summer).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Experience Times Square and a Broadway Show**  \n",
      "   Immerse yourself in the neon-lit energy of Times Square, then catch a world-class Broadway production. Whether it’s a musical, play, or improv show, this quintessential NYC experience blends culture and city vibrancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bonus Consideration:**  \n",
      "The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) and the Empire State Building’s observation deck are also highly recommended for art lovers and skyline enthusiasts, respectively."

Sam Rivera, dulled by fatigue yet driven by unshakeable resolve, manipulated a complex array of audio interfaces. \"There\\\\\\'s a pattern, a repeating motif. It\\\\\\'s structured, intentional,\" they muttered, their revelation a bridge between the known and the unimaginable. Taylor Cruz, a figure of central authority, paced the length of the room, their usual unflappable demeanor betraying a rare flicker of apprehension. \"We should be wary of the sirens’ call,\" Taylor interjected, invoking myths of old as a cautionary metaphor. \"We don\\\\\\'t want to crash upon unseen shores.\" Undeterred, Jordan cast a determined glance at the team. \"We navigate by starlight now, not by the limited light of our previous understanding.\" Their voice was a beacon, charting a course through unchartered realities.

We\\\\\\'re being woven into a narrative far grander than the sum of our known sciences.\" Taylor Cruz, arms crossed, wore the heavy mantle of their skepticism comfortably. \"Keep theorizing,\" they interjected crisply, \"but remember the grounding reality of what we are part of here. This contact is a blade that cuts both ways.\" In this cavern of history, voices both human and inhuman whispered secrets to those brave enough to listen. Each member present understood the gravity that pulled at their feet; no longer were they mere mortals shackled to their terrestrial plane. The digital pings and encrypted calls resonated with an implication of a cosmic agenda that would not be ignored. Jordan\\\\\\'s fingers paused, hovering in hesitation. What ripple might the next keystroke send through the fabric of known existence? It was a step into the ballet of the infinite, where the Paranormal Military Squad team played their part in the waltz of wonders with an audience of stars. \\\\\\\\* ## Chapter 15 In the clandestine hush of Dulce Base\\\\\\'s subterranean command center, the Paranormal Military Squad team had become a crucible for interstellar communication. Dr. Jordan Hayes\\\\\\' gaze lingered on the screen as they navigated through the convolution of alien code. Each character held the potential to unravel a new dimension\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'their harmony in the cosmic conversation. ## Chapter 14 The command center of Dulce Base lay shrouded in shadows that seemed to claw at the edges of the dimly lit array of screens and consoles. Alex Mercer, focused and unwavering, watched as Dr. Jordan Hayes parsed the latest string of alien signals—a symphony of otherworldly communications that threatened to either enlighten or confound. \"We’re encountering a paradigm shift with every transmission,\" Jordan Hayes murmured, the pulsing glow of the monitor painting their features with an almost spectral hue. \"This signal... it’s evolving, becoming denser, more sophisticated. As if it\\\\\\'s growing alongside us—tandem evolution.\" The air was electric, charged with the raw potential of uncharted discovery and laden with the gravity of existential risk. Taylor Cruz, who always seemed here to mold such gravity into actionable strategies, stepped forward. \"We must contain this evolution within parameters we can manage. We cannot be bystanders to an uncontrolled ascent of intelligence.\" Sam Rivera, the youngest of the cohort, worked feverishly at their station. \"It\\\\\\'s not just intelligence—these signals have rhythm, a kind of music suggesting not just evolution, but a dance! We\\\\\\'re being invited to partake in the cosmos\\\\\\'s ballet!\" they exclaimed, a touch of youthful exuberance breaking through the solemnity. Alex turned, facing his team, the stoic mask of command tempered by the perceptible flicker of awe in his gaze. \"Let this dance then be our dialogue. We will match their steps with prudent but daring measures—our humanity as our guide.\" In\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'now thrummed with a different kind of energy, an electric mix of fear and fascination. At the heart of the base, in a room shielded from the world’s eyes, Alex Mercer, Jordan Hayes, Taylor Cruz, and Sam Rivera huddled around a bank of monitors. Each screen flickered erratically with the alien script that had become the center of their lives—and perhaps the pivot on which humanity’s future would turn. Jordan\\\\\\'s eyes never wavered from the displays, their expression was one of rapt concentration, interspersed with flashes of revelation. \"We\\\\\\'re conversing with the stars,\" they whispered, almost to themselves. The words hung in the air, a testament to the awe-inspiring strangeness of the situation. \"The language is morphing; changing its structure with every exchange we have,\" Sam chimed in, enthusiasm tinged with the solemnity of the occasion. \"It\\\\\\'s like witnessing the birth of a new form of dialogue—one that spans galaxies.\" Taylor, despite the situation\\\\\\'s precariousness, maintained an appearance of ironclad composure. \"Keep the communication stream secured and monitored. We don\\\\\\'t know what we\\\\\\'re dealing with yet,\" they reminded the team, a bastion of protocol amidst uncertainty. Alex watched his team expand the parameters of human achievement; their work here would possibly define an era. \"This is untrodden territory,\" he acknowledged, \"and in every word we script, in every response we decode, we\\\\\\'re drawing a map that others will follow.\" Jordan turned to Alex, a nod acknowledging the shared responsibility of this moment. They had embarked on a new voyage, an\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'and intercepted comm signals from Dulce — a kaleidoscope of data that their curious and isolated mind hungered to decrypt. To an outsider, it might have looked like obsession, this fervent quest for answers. But to Sam, it was a dance — a give and take with the mysteries of the universe. Their fingers paused over the keyboard as they leaned back in the chair, whispering to thin air, \"What secrets are you hiding from us?\" The stillness of the room broke with the unexpected arrival of Alex Mercer, whose encroaching shadow loomed over Sam\\\\\\'s workspace. The cybersecurity expert craned their neck upwards, met by the ever-so-slight furrow in Alex\\\\\\'s brow. \"Got a minute, Rivera?\" \"Always,\" Sam said, a smile surfacing as they swiveled to face their mentor more directly. _He has that look — like something\\\\\\'s not sitting right with him,_ they noted inwardly. Alex hesitated, weighing his words carefully. \"Our tech is top-tier, but the silence from Dulce... It\\\\\\'s not just technology that will see us through, it\\\\\\'s intuition and... trust.\" His gaze pierced through the digital haze, trying to instill something more profound than advice. Sam regarded Alex for a moment, the sincerity in his voice resonating with their own unspoken desire to prove their worth. \"Intuition,\" they mirrored thoughtfully. \"I guess sometimes the numbers don\\\\\\'t have all the answers.\" Their shared silence held a newfound understanding, a recognition that between the ones and zeros, it was their combined human insights that might prevail against the impossible.\\'}], \\'status\\': \\'OK\\', \\'time\\': \\'26.610959ms\\'}]\\n</documents>\\n\\n '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Who is the main character and what motivates them?'}]\n",

It\\\\\\'s more than a call; it\\\\\\'s a song, an interstellar siren’s call.\" Alex Mercer, steady and resilient in the face of the incomprehensible, acknowledged with a quiet nod, \"A song that we need to learn—quickly.\" His eyes, heavy with responsibility, scanned the room, watching his team work tirelessly at the intersection of science and speculation. Sam Rivera, dulled by fatigue yet driven by unshakeable resolve, manipulated a complex array of audio interfaces. \"There\\\\\\'s a pattern, a repeating motif. It\\\\\\'s structured, intentional,\" they muttered, their revelation a bridge between the known and the unimaginable. Taylor Cruz, a figure of central authority, paced the length of the room, their usual unflappable demeanor betraying a rare flicker of apprehension. \"We should be wary of the sirens’ call,\" Taylor interjected, invoking myths of old as a cautionary metaphor. \"We don\\\\\\'t want to crash upon unseen shores.\" Undeterred, Jordan cast a determined glance at the team. \"We navigate by starlight now, not by the limited light of our previous understanding.\" Their voice was a beacon, charting a course through unchartered realities. Every individual was acutely aware that each moment in that room was a conduit to an epochal shift for civilization. The mysterious signals, once distant and alien,\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'each other, evolving together through this.. dialogue. Like it knows us, understands us, and it\\\\\\'s… learning.\" Jordan Hayes, preoccupied at a nearby console, chimed in without lifting their gaze. \"It\\\\\\'s a dialogue that transcends mere words, Alex. We\\\\\\'re being woven into a narrative far grander than the sum of our known sciences.\" Taylor Cruz, arms crossed, wore the heavy mantle of their skepticism comfortably. \"Keep theorizing,\" they interjected crisply, \"but remember the grounding reality of what we are part of here. This contact is a blade that cuts both ways.\" In this cavern of history, voices both human and inhuman whispered secrets to those brave enough to listen. Each member present understood the gravity that pulled at their feet; no longer were they mere mortals shackled to their terrestrial plane. The digital pings and encrypted calls resonated with an implication of a cosmic agenda that would not be ignored. Jordan\\\\\\'s fingers paused, hovering in hesitation. What ripple might the next keystroke send through the fabric of known existence? It was a step into the ballet of the infinite, where the Paranormal Military Squad team played their part in the waltz of wonders with an audience of stars. \\\\\\\\* ## Chapter 15 In the clandestine hush of Dulce Base\\\\\\'s subterranean command center, the Paranormal Military Squad team had become a crucible for interstellar communication. Dr. Jordan Hayes\\\\\\' gaze lingered on the screen as they navigated through the convolution of alien code. Each character held the potential to unravel a new dimension\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'their harmony in the cosmic conversation. ## Chapter 14 The command center of Dulce Base lay shrouded in shadows that seemed to claw at the edges of the dimly lit array of screens and consoles. Alex Mercer, focused and unwavering, watched as Dr. Jordan Hayes parsed the latest string of alien signals—a symphony of otherworldly communications that threatened to either enlighten or confound. \"We’re encountering a paradigm shift with every transmission,\" Jordan Hayes murmured, the pulsing glow of the monitor painting their features with an almost spectral hue. \"This signal... it’s evolving, becoming denser, more sophisticated. As if it\\\\\\'s growing alongside us—tandem evolution.\" The air was electric, charged with the raw potential of uncharted discovery and laden with the gravity of existential risk. Taylor Cruz, who always seemed here to mold such gravity into actionable strategies, stepped forward. \"We must contain this evolution within parameters we can manage. We cannot be bystanders to an uncontrolled ascent of intelligence.\" Sam Rivera, the youngest of the cohort, worked feverishly at their station. \"It\\\\\\'s not just intelligence—these signals have rhythm, a kind of music suggesting not just evolution, but a dance! We\\\\\\'re being invited to partake in the cosmos\\\\\\'s ballet!\" they exclaimed, a touch of youthful exuberance breaking through the solemnity. Alex turned, facing his team, the stoic mask of command tempered by the perceptible flicker of awe in his gaze. \"Let this dance then be our dialogue. We will match their steps with prudent but daring measures—our humanity as our guide.\" In\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'now thrummed with a different kind of energy, an electric mix of fear and fascination. At the heart of the base, in a room shielded from the world’s eyes, Alex Mercer, Jordan Hayes, Taylor Cruz, and Sam Rivera huddled around a bank of monitors. Each screen flickered erratically with the alien script that had become the center of their lives—and perhaps the pivot on which humanity’s future would turn. Jordan\\\\\\'s eyes never wavered from the displays, their expression was one of rapt concentration, interspersed with flashes of revelation. \"We\\\\\\'re conversing with the stars,\" they whispered, almost to themselves. The words hung in the air, a testament to the awe-inspiring strangeness of the situation. \"The language is morphing; changing its structure with every exchange we have,\" Sam chimed in, enthusiasm tinged with the solemnity of the occasion. \"It\\\\\\'s like witnessing the birth of a new form of dialogue—one that spans galaxies.\" Taylor, despite the situation\\\\\\'s precariousness, maintained an appearance of ironclad composure. \"Keep the communication stream secured and monitored. We don\\\\\\'t know what we\\\\\\'re dealing with yet,\" they reminded the team, a bastion of protocol amidst uncertainty. Alex watched his team expand the parameters of human achievement; their work here would possibly define an era. \"This is untrodden territory,\" he acknowledged, \"and in every word we script, in every response we decode, we\\\\\\'re drawing a map that others will follow.\" Jordan turned to Alex, a nod acknowledging the shared responsibility of this moment. They had embarked on a new voyage, an\\'}, {\\'chunk\\': \\'and intercepted comm signals from Dulce — a kaleidoscope of data that their curious and isolated mind hungered to decrypt. To an outsider, it might have looked like obsession, this fervent quest for answers. But to Sam, it was a dance — a give and take with the mysteries of the universe. Their fingers paused over the keyboard as they leaned back in the chair, whispering to thin air, \"What secrets are you hiding from us?\" The stillness of the room broke with the unexpected arrival of Alex Mercer, whose encroaching shadow loomed over Sam\\\\\\'s workspace. The cybersecurity expert craned their neck upwards, met by the ever-so-slight furrow in Alex\\\\\\'s brow. \"Got a minute, Rivera?\" \"Always,\" Sam said, a smile surfacing as they swiveled to face their mentor more directly. _He has that look — like something\\\\\\'s not sitting right with him,_ they noted inwardly. Alex hesitated, weighing his words carefully. \"Our tech is top-tier, but the silence from Dulce... It\\\\\\'s not just technology that will see us through, it\\\\\\'s intuition and... trust.\" His gaze pierced through the digital haze, trying to instill something more profound than advice. Sam regarded Alex for a moment, the sincerity in his voice resonating with their own unspoken desire to prove their worth. \"Intuition,\" they mirrored thoughtfully. \"I guess sometimes the numbers don\\\\\\'t have all the answers.\" Their shared silence held a newfound understanding, a recognition that between the ones and zeros, it was their combined human insights that might prevail against the impossible.\\'}], \\'status\\': \\'OK\\', \\'time\\': \\'2.767333ms\\'}]\\n</documents>\\n<knowledge graph>\\n[{\\'result\\': [{\\'->RELATED_TO\\': [{\\'description\\': \\'Alex Mercer operates within Dulce Base during Operation: Dulce.\\', \\'out\\': RecordID(table_name=PLACE, record_id=DULCE BASE), \\'strength\\': 9}, {\\'description\\': \\'Alex Mercer and Taylor Cruz are both members of the Paranormal Military Squad and work together on Operation: Dulce.\\', \\'out\\': RecordID(table_name=PERSON, record_id=TAYLOR CRUZ), \\'strength\\': 8}, {\\'description\\': \\'Alex Mercer reports to and receives orders from Washington D.C.\\', \\'out\\': RecordID(table_name=PLACE, record_id=WASHINGTON), \\'strength\\': 6}, {\\'description\\': \\'Alex Mercer and Jordan Hayes are both members of the Paranormal Military Squad and work closely together, sharing a mutual respect and understanding.\\', \\'out\\': RecordID(table_name=PERSON, record_id=JORDAN HAYES), \\'strength\\': 9}, {\\'description\\': \\'Alex Mercer leads the team during Operation: Dulce\\', \\'out\\': RecordID(table_name=PERSON, record_id=ALEX MERCER), \\'strength\\': 10}, {\\'description\\': \\'Alex Mercer and Sam Rivera are both members of the Paranormal Military Squad and work together on Operation: Dulce.

      "Okay, let me start by trying to figure out who the main character is here. The user provided some documents, which are chunks of text from a story. They want to know the main character and their motivations, in bullet points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first document chunk, the names mentioned are Dr. Jordan Hayes, Alex Mercer, Sam Rivera, and Taylor Cruz. All of them seem to be part of a team working on decoding an alien signal. The story seems to be a group effort, but maybe one of them stands out as the main character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first chunk, Dr. Jordan Hayes is mentioned as leading the efforts. Then in other chunks, Alex Mercer is interacting with Jordan, asking questions, and seems to be in a leadership role too. Taylor Cruz is giving commands and cautioning the team. Sam Rivera is working on technical aspects. But in the third chunk, Alex Mercer's eyes are fixed on monitors, and he's moving around, asking questions. The last chunk mentions Alex watching his team, indicating he might be a central figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motivation part: Jordan is motivated by understanding the signal, as they mention it's a song and they need to navigate by new understanding. Alex is focused on the mission's success and cautious strategy. Taylor is concerned with protocol and security. Sam is excited about the technical challenge. But the question is about the main character. If it's a team, maybe Alex Mercer is the main one since he's mentioned more in leadership context and his perspective is noted, like his thoughts and actions. Or maybe Jordan since they're leading the technical efforts. The documents mention both, but in the chunks, Alex is actively engaging with others and making strategic decisions. The last line also says Jordan turned to Alex, acknowledging shared responsibility. Maybe they are co-main characters, but the user might want the primary one. Alternatively, the main character could be Alex Mercer since he's portrayed as a leader, checking on progress, and his reactions are highlighted in multiple chunks. His motivation is ensuring the mission's success and navigating the unknown carefully. So, I'll list Alex as the main character with his motivations, and perhaps Jordan as another main character. But the user might expect one main character. Wait, in the documents, the team is working together, but the most recurring names are Alex and Jordan. However, the user asked for the main character, so maybe both? But the answer might need to pick one. Let me check again: in the first chunk, Jordan is leading, but in later chunks, Alex is taking a prominent role. The answer might include both but the user may want the primary. Alternatively, the main character is the team as a whole. But the question is about \"who is the main character,\" singular. Hmm. Maybe Alex Mercer is the main character, given his active role and leadership moments. His motivation is leading the team in deciphering the signal and ensuring cautious interaction. So, bullet points for Alex Mercer, with his role and motivations. But need to confirm from the text. Let me go through each chunk again.\n",

      "First chunk: Dr. Jordan Hayes leads the efforts. Then Alex Mercer is mentioned as steady and resilient. Second chunk: Alex asks Jordan about progress. Third chunk: Alex's eyes are fixed on monitors, he moves to Jordan, asks about entry points. Fourth chunk: Alex paces, advises caution. Fifth chunk: Alex watches the team. So, Alex is consistently present, active in discussions, making strategic decisions. Jordan is the technical expert. Taylor is the authority figure, Sam the tech. So maybe the main character is Alex Mercer. His motivation is ensuring the mission's success through cautious strategy. So bullet points would be:\n",

      "Okay, let me tackle this query step by step. The user wants a table of people that Alex Mercer communicates with, including their names, frequency of scenes, places they've been together ordered by importance, bond strength, and total interaction weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to look at the provided documents and the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph has entities like ALEX MERCER, JORDAN HAYES, SAM RIVERA, TAYLOR CRUZ, and TAYLOR CRUZ with their relationships. The documents mention interactions in Dulce Base and references to Washington as a command center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the knowledge graph, Alex Mercer is related to Jordan Hayes, Sam Rivera, and Taylor Cruz. Each of these relationships has a strength score. For example, Jordan Hayes has a strength of 9, Sam Rivera 7, and Taylor Cruz 8. Wait, wait, looking back: the knowledge graph shows Alex's RELATED_TO links. For Jordan, it's strength 9; Sam, 7; Taylor, 8 (but in the knowledge graph, under Taylor Cruz's entry, the strength with Alex isn't directly given. Wait, maybe I need to check each person's entry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, under Alex Mercer's RELATED_TO, the entries are Jordan Hayes (strength 9), Sam Rivera (7), Taylor Cruz (8?), let me check again. Wait, looking at Alex's RELATED_TO: 'Taylor Cruz' has strength 8. Because in Alex's entry, \"Alex Mercer and Taylor Cruz are both members... strength 8\". So yes, Jordan (9), Sam (7), Taylor (8). Washington is 6 but that's a place, not a person. So, the people Alex communicates with are Jordan, Sam, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, frequency of scenes. The documents have several scenes with these characters. From the document chunks, for example, in Chapter 11, Alex is with Sam, Taylor, Jordan in Dulce Base. In Chapter 6, they're in the command center. Since the documents provided are chunks from chapters 11, 6, etc., but the exact frequency isn't given. However, based on the knowledge graph's strength scores and the scenes described, I can infer that Jordan appears most frequently, then Taylor, then Sam. But maybe based on the number of mentions in the documents. Let me check the document chunks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first document chunk: mentions Alex, Sam, Taylor, Jordan. Second chunk: Sam, Alex, Jordan. Third: Jordan, Alex. Fourth: Alex, Jordan, Taylor. Fifth: Alex, Sam, Jordan, Taylor. So all three are frequently mentioned. But perhaps the frequency isn't clear, so perhaps the strength in the knowledge graph can be a proxy for frequency. Since Jordan has strength 9, Taylor 8, Sam 7. So frequency might be Jordan (High), Taylor (Medium), Sam (Medium). But the user wants a numerical frequency. Since the data doesn't specify exact counts, maybe assign frequencies based on the strength. Alternatively, the knowledge graph might have the strength as a measure of their interactions. Alternatively, the user might expect the strength to be in the bond column. Wait, the fourth column is bond strength, which is the strength from the knowledge graph. Then the fifth column is total weight, which might be a product of frequency and bond strength? Let's clarify.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that the documents provide scenes but not exact counts. The knowledge graph gives strength of relationships. The user might expect the frequency to be derived from the scenes in the documents. But the documents provided are multiple chunks from different chapters, each mentioning the team. For example, in each document chunk, Alex is interacting with Jordan, Sam, and Taylor. So if there are 5 document chunks, and in each, they are present, perhaps the frequency is similar. However, perhaps Jordan is mentioned more. Alternatively, the strength in the knowledge graph could be used for bond strength, and frequency based on the number of times they are in scenes together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the knowledge graph entries for Alex's related_to list the strength. For Jordan Hayes, strength 9, Sam Rivera 7, Taylor Cruz 8. So maybe that's the bond strength. Then frequency could be inferred from the number of scenes in the documents. Looking at the document chunks, each one seems to mention all three team members. For example:\n",

      "Fourth: Alex, Jordan, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth: Alex, Sam, Jordan, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe Jordan is in 5 scenes, Taylor in 3, Sam in 4? Not sure. Alternatively, since all are part of the team, maybe they all have high frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without exact counts, perhaps the frequency is High for Jordan, Medium for Taylor and Sam.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants a table with numerical frequency. Since the data isn't explicit, perhaps using the strength as a proxy. Alternatively, since the documents consistently mention all three, assign frequency as 'Frequent' or use numbers like 5 for Jordan, 4 for Taylor, 3 for Sam. But how to derive this? Alternatively, the problem might expect to use the strength as the bond strength and assign frequency based on the number of RELATED_TO entries, but that's not directly applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, in the knowledge graph, each person's RELATED_TO entry under Alex gives the strength. So Alex has:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Jordan Hayes: strength 9\n",
      "\n",
      "- Taylor Cruz: strength 8\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sam Rivera: strength 7\n",
      "\n",
      "So three people. Then, places they had scenes together: Dulce Base is mentioned in all their operations. So for each person, the place is Dulce Base. The knowledge graph mentions Washington as a place they report to, but the scenes are in Dulce Base. So places ordered by importance: Dulce Base (most important), maybe Washington (less, as it's a command center but not the scene location).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bond strength is the strength from the knowledge graph: 9, 8, 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total weight could be a product of frequency and bond strength. But frequency isn't numerical. Alternatively, if frequency is based on the number of scenes, and each has, say, 5 scenes, then total weight is 5*9=45 for Jordan, etc. But without exact scene counts, perhaps total weight is the same as bond strength, or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user says \"score the total weight of the interactions across the scenes in aggregate\". If the interactions are more frequent and have higher bond strength, the total weight would be higher. But without exact data, perhaps the total weight is the strength multiplied by some frequency factor. If all have the same frequency, then the total weight would be the bond strength. Alternatively, maybe the strength already aggregates that. But since the knowledge graph's strength is given, perhaps the total weight is that strength.\n",

      "Looking at the knowledge graph, Alex Mercer is related to Dulce Base and Washington D.C. The documents mention Dulce Base several times, especially in the context of the command center where the team works. Washington D.C. is mentioned in the 'RELATED_TO' relationships as a place where Alex and others report to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's check the places. The knowledge graph shows Alex is related to Dulce Base with strength 9 and Washington with strength 6. Dulce Base is clearly the main location in the documents, described as an underground facility. Washington is mentioned as a reporting location but not as a place he's physically present in the scenes provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people with Alex at Dulce Base are Jordan Hayes (strength 9), Sam Rivera (7), and Taylor Cruz (8 based on the team context). The importance of Dulce Base is high since it's the main setting. The description from the docs mentions it's a subterranean facility with high-tech equipment, used for interstellar communication. The interaction weight would sum the strengths: 9 (Jordan) + 7 (Sam) + 8 (Taylor) = 24. Wait, actually, the strength for Taylor in Alex's relations is 8? Let me check. In Alex's 'RELATED_TO', Taylor Cruz has strength 8. So adding those three gives 9 + 8 + 7 = 24. \n",
      "\n",
      "Washington D.C. is another place, but the documents don't show Alex physically visiting there; it's more of a command center they report to. So frequency would be 'Occasional (command center)' as per the knowledge graph. However, the documents don't mention him being there in the provided scenes, so maybe frequency is lower or inferred from reporting. The people associated would be higher-ups, but not specified in the docs. However, the knowledge graph shows Alex reports to Washington, but no specific people are listed there with him. So maybe this place isn't visited in the scenes provided, but since it's in the KG, should it be included? The user might expect it because it's in the KG, but the documents don't show Alex actually going there. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says \"places that Alex visits\" based on the documents and KG. The KG says he operates within Dulce Base and reports to Washington. So Dulce Base is where he's present. Washington might be a place he interacts with remotely. The user might consider Washington as a place he 'visits' in terms of reporting, but if the scenes don't show him there, maybe it's not a physical visit. But the KG includes it as a related place, so perhaps it should be included with a lower frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequency: For Dulce Base, he's there frequently as the main setting. Washington might be occasional. \n",
      "\n",
      "People at Washington: Since the KG mentions that Alex reports to Washington, but the documents don't specify who is there, maybe the people are not listed. But the KG entries for others (like Taylor Cruz) also report to Washington. However, if the team is at Dulce, then Washington might have other personnel not mentioned. But since the user wants people present with Alex, and if he's not physically there, maybe leave that column blank or N/A. Alternatively, if reporting implies virtual presence, but the question is about places he visits, which might mean physically. So perhaps only Dulce Base is the actual place he visits, and Washington is a place he's related to but doesn't physically visit in the provided docs. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instructions say to use both documents and the KG. The KG has Washington as a related place with strength 6. So maybe include it but note that the frequency is occasional, and the interactions are remote. However, the people there aren't specified, so maybe list as N/A. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the KG for Alex shows -> RELATED_TO Washington with strength 6. The description says \"reports to and receives orders from Washington D.C.\" So it's a command center, but he's not there physically in the scenes. So perhaps frequency is \"Rarely\" or \"Occasionally (remote)\" and people are \"Command personnel (unspecified)\". But the user wants the people who were there with him, so if he's not physically present, maybe it's not applicable. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since the KG includes Washington as a place he's related to, but the documents don't show him being there, maybe the answer should only include Dulce Base. The problem is that the user may expect both, but based on the provided data, only Dulce Base is mentioned in the documents as a location where scenes take place. Washington is part of the KG but not in the scenes. So perhaps the answer should only include Dulce Base. But the KG might have other places, but in this case, only Dulce and Washington are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, final table would have Dulce Base with frequency \"Frequent (primary operational base)\", people Jordan, Sam, Taylor with their strengths, importance \"Critical (central hub for operations)\", description as underground high-tech facility, interaction weight sum 24. Washington D.C. might be included with frequency \"Occasional (command center)\", but without people present with him, importance \"High (command authority)\", description as US capital, etc. But since the scenes don't show him there, maybe exclude it. The user might want all places related from the KG, regardless of document mentions. Need to check the KG.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the KG, under Alex's RELATED_TO, the places are Dulce Base (strength 9) and Washington (6). So both should be included. But in the documents, is Washington mentioned? Looking at the documents, the text snippets don't mention Washington; the scenes are all at Dulce Base. So the KG has Washington as a related place, but the documents don't show Alex visiting there. However, the user's question says to use both documents and KG. So including both places makes sense, even if Washington isn't in the scenes. \n",
      "\n",
      "For Washington's frequency: Since he reports there, maybe \"Regular (command center contact)\" but physically not visited. But the frequency is about visits. If he's never there physically, frequency might be \"Rare\" or \"None\" based on documents, but KG says he's related. This is a bit ambiguous. The KG's related_to for place might indicate association, not physical presence. The user might want places he actually visits, so based on documents, only Dulce Base. But the KG adds Washington. Need to clarify. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user's instruction says: \"places that Alex visits\" based on documents and KG. So if the KG says he's related to Washington (as in reports to), but the documents don't show him being there, do we include it? Maybe yes, but with a note that it's a command center he interacts with remotely. So in the table:\n",
      "\n",
      "Place Name | Frequency | People Present | Importance | Description | Interaction Weight\n",
      "--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n",
      "Dulce Base | Frequent | Jordan Hayes (9), Sam Rivera (7), Taylor Cruz (8) | Critical | Underground military facility with advanced tech for interstellar communication. | 24 (9+7+8)\n",
      "Washington D.C. | Occasional | Command personnel (unspecified) | High | U.S. capital; command center overseeing operations. | 6\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem is the 'people present' column requires listing those with him at the place. For Washington, if he's not there physically, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, since the KG doesn't specify people there, leave it blank. However, the strength for Washington is 6, but that's the strength of the relation between Alex and Washington, not people. So maybe Washington's row has no people listed. Alternatively, the KG entries for other team members also relate to Washington, but that doesn't mean they are there with Alex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, the safest approach is to only include Dulce Base in the table, as Washington's presence isn't physical in the provided data. The user might have intended to include all related places, but unless the visits are physical, it's better to stick to the documents. However, the KG does mention Washington as a place Alex is related to, so perhaps it's worth including with a note. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the table includes Dulce Base with all details and Washington D.C. with limited info. But I need to check if the interaction weight for Washington is 6, which is the strength of Alex's relation to the place, not interactions. The interaction weight column is supposed to score the total weight of interactions across scenes. Since Washington isn't in the scenes, its weight would be 6 (from the KG), but that's the strength of the relation, not interactions. The user's instruction for column 6 is \"score the total weight of the interactions across the scenes in aggregate.\" If the scenes don't include Washington, then its weight is 0. But the KG's strength might be considered as part of the importance. This is confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the interaction weight is the sum of the strengths of the people present. For Dulce Base, it's 9+8+7=24. For Washington, if there are no people present with Alex, the weight is 0. But the KG's strength for Washington is 6, which might relate to the place's importance. However, the user's column 6 is about interaction weight in scenes, so maybe only Dulce Base has that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, the final table would only include Dulce Base, as Washington isn't visited in the scenes described. The KG's relation to Washington is about command structure, not physical visits. Therefore, the answer should focus on Dulce Base.\n",

His top connections are with Jordan Hayes (strength 9), Taylor Cruz (strength 8), Sam Rivera (strength 7), and Dulce Base (strength 9). Places important to the plot are Dulce Base and Washington, but Dulce Base has a higher strength in his relationships.\n",

The emotional charge comes from their roles as protectors and interpreters, the high stakes, and their unity.\n",

      "Now, condensing that into 20 words. Mention the team, the monitors with alien script, the setting (Dulce Base), and the mood (tense, illuminated by monitors' glow).

      "First, I'll review the documents to identify the main characters and settings. The main characters mentioned are Dr. Jordan Hayes, Alex Mercer, Sam Rivera, and Taylor Cruz. They're working in a high-tech command center, likely part of the Dulce Base. The plot revolves around decoding an alien signal, which is described as a song or a cosmic dialogue. The team is under pressure, dealing with the implications of making contact with an alien civilization.\n",

There's a mention of pivotal moments in the command center where the team works together intensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emotionally charged scenes would involve moments of tension, collaboration, or breakthrough. In the documents, there's a scene in Chapter 12 where the team is huddled around monitors in Dulce Base, the alien script flickering, and they're in the midst of a breakthrough. Jordan mentions conversing with the stars, and Alex reflects on their role in mapping a new era. This scene combines the key relationships (Alex with Jordan, Sam, and Taylor), the central location (Dulce Base command center), and the high stakes of their mission.\n",

      "For an 8-bit video game style cover, the scene should have pixel art elements, vibrant colors, and a retro feel. The command center with monitors displaying alien code, the team united, and cosmic elements (stars, signals) would translate well.
