    "# Using a SurrealDB Knowedge Graph and Gemini to build a Graph-RAG \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates the implementation and utilization of a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a knowledge graph stored in SurrealDB. It focuses on leveraging the knowledge graph created by the graph_extractor.ipynb notebook for question answering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionality\n",
    "####  Data Loading:\n",
    "        Loads the raw text data from which will be used for context in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Leveraging the Existing Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Create a SurrQL function to query the knowledge graph using vector search for the descriptions of the entities and the other entities and relationships they have in the graph. This data will also be fed into the prompt for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Response Generation without a knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a simple context window of the text data loaded earlier with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",

    "#### Response Generation with knowledge graph:\n",
    "    Using a template prompt in the RAG_prompts.py file a context window of the text data loaded earlier, plus the graph data retrieved from SurrealDB with the question is asked of the LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### notes:\n",
    "    This notebook utilizes libraries :\n",
    "        surrealdb to interact with SurrealDB\n",
    "        google.generativeai to interact with Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prerquisite is to install the embedding model as in this python script:\n",
    "            https://github.com/apireno/surrealDB_embedding_model\n",
    "            and load a knowledge graph using the other notebook in this repo: graph_extractor.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "    The notebook is loosely based on a larger repository microsoft/graphrag. The microsoft/graphrag repository provides a more comprehensive, modular graph-based RAG system. This notebook focuses specifically on the knowledge graph construction aspect."

       "\n",
       "* **Sam Rivera:**  The knowledge graph shows a strong connection (strength 7) between Alex and Sam. The text reveals that Alex mentors Sam, suggesting care and investment in Sam's development.  This suggests a mentor-mentee relationship that likely involves a degree of respect and concern.\n",
       "\n",

The text suggests that their relationship is complex, with Taylor's authoritative style sometimes clashing with Alex's independent thinking.

The walls would be dark grey/blue blocks, with various shades of grey and blue used to suggest depth and texture.

       "Here's a description of an 8-bit video game style book cover, based on the provided text and knowledge graph:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Book Cover Title:** Operation: Dulce\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Style:** 8-bit pixel art, reminiscent of classic NES or SNES RPGs.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Scene Depicted:** The cover art depicts the climax of the novel, where the team is in the Dulce Base command center engaging in their first interstellar communication.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Elements:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Background:** A pixelated depiction of the Dulce Base command center.  Use a dark blue/grey color palette for the walls and floors. Monitors displaying streams of alien code should dominate the background, using various shades of green and blue pixels to create a sense of technology and mystery.  A few flickering pixels suggest the power surges described.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Characters:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    * **Alex Mercer:**  In the center foreground, slightly larger than the other characters to denote his leadership.  Depict him in pixelated 8-bit military attire (dark green jacket, darker pants) looking intently at a monitor, holding his rifle loosely, suggesting a balance of readiness and focused engagement.  Give him a determined expression with fairly detailed pixel eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "    * **Jordan Hayes:** To Alex's left, slightly smaller but still prominent. They are dressed in more scientific attire (a white lab coat).  Their head is tilted toward a monitor, highlighting their role in deciphering the alien code, and their expression shows intense concentration.\n",
       "\n",
       "    * **Taylor Cruz:**  To Alex's right, slightly smaller and similarly outfitted as Alex but with more angular features to reflect their more severe personality. Their expression shows a blend of apprehension and calculated determination.\n",
       "\n",
       "    * **Sam Rivera:**  Smaller than the others, positioned slightly behind and between Alex and Taylor, hunched over a computer console displaying alien symbols. Their 8-bit design could include bright, colorful clothes to represent their youthful energy and tech-savvy nature. Their expression could be one of excited concentration.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Color Palette:** Primarily dark blues, greens, and greys for the background and characters' attire, representing the shadowy base. Brighter greens, blues, and possibly yellows should be used for the monitors to highlight the alien code.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall Impression:** The cover should evoke a sense of mystery, tension, and impending discovery. The pixel art style should be clean and well-defined, avoiding too much detail to maintain the 8-bit aesthetic. The limited color palette should enhance the mood and style.  The overall scene should focus on the team in the midst of interaction with alien intelligence, highlighting both the excitement and the danger. The title \"Operation: Dulce\" should be prominently displayed in a classic 8-bit font, possibly with a pixelated glow effect.\n"
